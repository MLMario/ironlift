  <what-built>
Complete Phase 7 implementation:
1. Settings bottom sheet on dashboard (gear icon -> 3 menu items)
2. Workout History screen (paginated timeline with sticky stats, infinite scroll)
3. Workout Detail screen (exercise blocks with category badges and set grids)
4. My Exercises screen (list, inline edit, delete with dependency warnings, create modal)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Settings Bottom Sheet:**
1. Open the app and tap the gear icon on the dashboard header
2. Verify bottom sheet slides up with three menu items: My Exercises, Workout History, Log Out
3. Verify Log Out is styled in red/danger color and separated by a divider
4. Swipe down or tap backdrop to dismiss -- verify sheet closes
5. Tap gear icon again to reopen

**Workout History:**
6. Tap "Workout History" -- sheet dismisses, then history screen pushes
7. Verify sticky stats bar at top (total workouts, sets, volume)
8. Verify timeline with decorative vertical line and accent-colored dots
9. Verify each card shows template name, exercise count, sets, volume badges
10. Verify date markers in "Feb 5" format
11. Scroll to bottom -- verify more items load automatically (if >7 workouts exist)
12. If no workouts exist, verify "No workout history yet" empty state

**Workout Detail:**
13. From History, tap a workout card
14. Verify header shows template name (or "Untitled Workout") + full date (e.g., "Feb 5, 2026")
15. Verify exercise blocks with color-coded category badges (Chest=red, Back=blue, etc.)
16. Verify set grid shows set number, weight, reps, and status icon (checkmark for done, X for skipped)
17. Tap back button -- verify return to History screen

**My Exercises:**
18. Return to dashboard, tap gear icon, tap "My Exercises"
19. If custom exercises exist: verify alphabetical list with name and category
20. Tap edit icon on an exercise -- verify inline form expands with name, category, cancel/save
21. Tap edit on a different exercise -- verify first one collapses
22. Test validation: clear name and save (should show error), use special characters (should show error)
23. Make a valid edit and save -- verify list updates
24. Tap delete icon -- verify dependency warning shows counts (if exercise is used)
25. Confirm delete -- verify exercise removed from list
26. Tap + button in header -- verify create modal opens
27. Create a new exercise -- verify it appears in the list
28. If no exercises: verify empty state with "Create Exercise" button

**Navigation:**
29. From any sub-screen, tap back -- verify return to dashboard
30. From Workout Detail, tap back -- verify return to History
31. Tap gear icon, tap "Log Out" -- verify logged out

Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found.
