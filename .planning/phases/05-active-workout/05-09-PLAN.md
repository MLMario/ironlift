<objective>
Fix RestTimerBar cosmetic issues: invisible inactive fill color and thin bar track.

Purpose: UAT round 3 found that the inactive fill color (#27272a bgElevated) is indistinguishable from the track color (#2a2a2a border), making the bar appear empty when it should appear full. The bar is also too thin (8px) compared to the 44px buttons beside it.

Output: Updated RestTimerBar.tsx with visible inactive fill and thicker bar track.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix inactive fill color and increase bar track height</name>
  <files>src/components/RestTimerBar.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Make three changes in RestTimerBar.tsx:

    1. **Line 72 — Inactive fill color:** Change `theme.colors.bgElevated` to `theme.colors.textMuted`. The current bgElevated (#27272a) is the same shade as the track background border (#2a2a2a), making the fill invisible. textMuted (#71717a) provides clear contrast against the dark track while reading as a subdued/inactive state compared to the bright blue accent (#4f9eff) used for active fills.

    2. **Line 132 — Bar track height:** Change `height: 8` to `height: 28`. This makes the track visually proportional to the 44px min-height buttons flanking it. The barContainer (line 128-130) is already 28px height, so the track will now fill the container vertically.

    3. **Line 151 — Time text size:** Change `fontSize: theme.typography.sizes.xs` to `fontSize: theme.typography.sizes.sm` in the timeText style. With the taller track, the time text overlay should be slightly larger to remain readable and proportional inside the 28px bar.

    Do NOT change any other styles or logic. The barFill height is already '100%' so it will automatically fill the new 28px track height.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to confirm no type errors. Visually inspect on device:
    - Before any set is marked done, each exercise's timer bar should show a visible gray-filled bar (not invisible/empty).
    - After a countdown finishes, the timer bar should reset to a visible gray-filled bar.
    - The bar track should be noticeably thicker (~28px), visually balanced with the +/-10s buttons.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Inactive timer bar has a clearly visible gray fill (textMuted color) that contrasts with the dark track. Bar track is 28px tall, proportional to the 44px buttons. Time text is readable at sm size inside the thicker bar. Active timer fill remains blue (accent color, unchanged).
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- Inactive fill color is theme.colors.textMuted (not bgElevated)
- barTrack height is 28 (not 8)
- timeText fontSize is theme.typography.sizes.sm (not xs)
- Active fill color remains theme.colors.accent (unchanged)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Timer bar is visibly filled when inactive (before first set done and after countdown ends)
- Timer bar track is thick enough to be visually proportional to the +/-10s buttons
- Time text is readable inside the thicker bar
- No regressions to active countdown behavior
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-active-workout/05-09-SUMMARY.md`
