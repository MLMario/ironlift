# Milestone v0.1: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-16
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 42

## Overview

IronLift is a native iOS exercise tracker ported from the IronFactor web app. The roadmap progressed from project foundation and theming through authentication, exercise library, template management, the core workout loop, progress charts, and history browsing with settings -- each phase delivering a complete, verifiable capability. The core workout loop (Phase 5) was the product's centerpiece; everything before it built prerequisites, everything after it closed the feedback loop.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Theme

**Goal**: App runs on a physical iPhone via Expo Go with a working theme system, navigation structure, and Supabase connection
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Project scaffolding, dependency installation, web app file port
- [x] 01-02: Theme system (tokens, provider, hook) and Supabase client

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None (all integer phases)

**Key Decisions:**

- Expo (React Native) over Swift/Capacitor for TypeScript reuse and Expo Go dev workflow
- Copy-and-diverge from web app (standalone project, no shared packages)
- AsyncStorage over SQLite for caching (~16MB lifetime, JSON key-value sufficient)
- Hub-and-spoke navigation over tab bar (dashboard-centric model)
- Hand-rolled UI over component libraries (full control, no lock-in)
- react-native-gifted-charts over victory-native (Expo Go compatible, no Skia)
- Local notifications only for rest timer (no server involvement)
- Email/password auth only (mirror web app, simplest path)
- Full feature parity for v1 (all web app features in scope)
- @gorhom/bottom-sheet for settings (Phase 7), then replaced with stack navigation (Phase 10)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Login routing fix: reset-password screen declaration order causing redirect loop
- Dashboard layout overhaul: single column replacing 2-column grid for iOS
- useWorkoutState initialization race condition with async dependencies
- Set row opacity leak during swipe-to-delete animation
- RestTimerBar visibility (fill color, bar thickness, text contrast)
- Chart horizontal scrolling replaced with fit-to-width display
- KebabMenu positioning via View.measure() for reliable screen coordinates
- Timer editing: tap-to-edit with blur revert on invalid input

**Issues Deferred:**

- Previous workout values displayed inline during active workout (GAP-01)
- Workout duration tracking (GAP-02)
- Personal record detection (GAP-03)
- Supersets/exercise grouping (ENRC-01)
- Phase 8 SUMMARY.md not created (minor documentation gap)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- No automated tests written (manual testing on physical device only)
- Some rgba color approximations for semi-transparent backgrounds
- Sound asset directory uses .gitkeep placeholder (no real MP3 sourced)
- Supabase Dashboard manual configuration needed (redirect URL, email confirmation, password length)
