# Pending

- Redesign exercise card add and remove bottom
- timer behaviour, only actvates one exercise a time or something weird -> change model to per exercise time
- exercise cards should start collapsed
- Add exercise botton also inda weird? maybe check other options
- modals are also ugly, need some work
- my templ;ates section

Gaps:

Minor

Charts

- when axis is sessions we should put an axis title
- see if we can make that chart stop scrolling up and odwn when pointer is being worked.
- Subtitble with X axis type: Session / by Date

- chart reload state should only happend when workout is saved, not on every action.

- template timer on the center
- no smooth line, just straigh

Template Grids:

- Create a template message when templates are empty, create a template to start logging your workout
- Log a wrokout subtitle only appear when templates >1
