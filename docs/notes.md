- Redesign exercise card add and remove bottom
- timer behaviour, only actvates one exercise a time or something weird -> change model to per exercise time
- exercise cards should start collapsed
- Add exercise botton also inda weird? maybe check other options
- modals are also ugly, need some work
- my templ;ates section

Gaps:

Minor

- when axis is sessions we should put an axis title
- see if we can make that chart stop scrolling up and odwn when pointer is being worked.

Major:

- chart reload state should only happend when workout is saved, not on every action.
- timer value does not appear until an exercise has been completed

- timer i snot editable until it appears and we whanbt .
- Settings Menu should be a stacked screen from the righ

- flow: create new exercise, added a chart when only one workout logged, got right message of at least two workouts, I logged several more workout but is still stuck
